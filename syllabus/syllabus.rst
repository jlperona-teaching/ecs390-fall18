==========================================
ECS 390 - The Teaching of Computer Science
==========================================

Class and People
----------------

Seminars
~~~~~~~~

    *Monday*: 16:10 - 17:00, 1150 Hart

    *Monday, alternate*: 17:10 - 18:00, 1150 Hart

For the days in which we'll be doing presentations, there will be a second seminar an hour later, in the same room.
There's too many people in the class to be able to have everybody present in only one hour per week, so we're going to split up into two groups for the presentations.

The above only applies for the presentation days.
For the first and fifth classes, everybody will show up at 16:10.

Instructor
~~~~~~~~~~

**Justin Perona** (jlperona at ucdavis dot edu)

Emails to me about the course should have the tag **[ECS 390]** (including the brackets) in the title.

Office hours by appointment only.
Email me to schedule an appointment.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Participation as a Teaching Assistant or Associate-In in a designated engineering course.
Methods of leading discussion groups or lab sections, writing and grading quizzes, use of lab equipment, and grading lab reports.
May be repeated for credit.

Course Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Student will develop the skills to effectively lead responsive, informative discussion sections.
2. Student will be able to develop efficient and fair methods of grading student programs and tests.
3. Student will learn about the various resources available to student instructors on campus.

The whole point of this class is for you to improve as an instructor.
(I get to improve as an instructor as well by teaching this class, so everyone wins!)
It doesn't matter if you've had previous experience teaching or not, you can *always* improve and make things better.

Websites
--------

Github
~~~~~~

Github_ will serve as the open-source repository for some of the course content, including the syllabus (this document), the schedule, and any presentation notes I post.

I'm a big fan of making things open-source wherever possible, hence this repository.
My Github repository for `ECS 154A`_, a class I taught previously, is a good past example of that.

Canvas
~~~~~~

Canvas_ will serve as the discussion board for the class, as well as where you'll submit your assignments and get back your grades.

Feel free to post questions on the `Discussions tab`_ of Canvas.
I'll make any announcements on the `Announcements tab`_.

Coursework and Grades
---------------------

Course Grading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The course is graded on a Satisfactory / Unsatisfactory (S/U) basis.
There are 30 points possible, described in more detail in the sections below.
You need 90% of the points possible to get an S.
This means you can miss either one class, or one of the assignments for your specific track (see below) and still come out with an S.

You must do both presentations to pass the class.
If you can't make your presentation date because of an emergency, let me know as soon as you can.

Required Coursework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attendance and Weekly Assignments
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Attendance for each class is mandatory.
On presentation days, you only need to attend one of the seminars for that day to get credit.
If you sign up for the later time slot, attend the later time slot for the rest of the weeks for that presentation.
This is so that we can get equal amounts of feedback for presenters for each week.

In addition to the attendance, there will usually be something that you need to submit on Canvas for that week as well.
These are *usually* due at 23:59 on Fridays, but check the due date carefully.
The first one tells me if you're a discussion leader or not.
Seven of the remaining eight will be your feedback on the presentations for that week.

There are 9 seminars, so you get 18 points from attendance.
You need to attend class as well as submit the associated assignment to get credit for that week.

Presentations
"""""""""""""

There will be two different presentations that everybody will make.
One will be a short 3-minute presentation in the first half of the quarter.
The other will be a longer 5-minute presentation in the second half of the quarter.
You will leave some time to answer questions at the end.
This will be followed by feedback from the class and me.

You can present on anything that you want within reason (nothing obscene, please).
Some of my favorite presentation topics have been on styling product-induced hair loss, why Drake's entire discography is a thinly veiled suicide note, and how not to be a bad cyclist on campus (complete with a demonstration).
Feel free to get creative, it makes it more fun.

Each presentation is worth 3 points, for a total of 6 points.
I won't be grading on content or anything like that.
As long as you made a genuine attempt, and attempted to improve on the second presentation versus the first, you'll get credit.

While people are presenting, everybody else will be writing down notes on what the presenter did well, and what they could improve on.
You'll submit these electronically on Canvas after the class is over.
This constitutes part of your attendance for each week.

Track A - Discussion Leaders
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

There's two different tracks, depending on whether or not you'll be leading discussions this quarter or not.
For discussion leaders, your two assignments revolve around your discussions.

Each of the observations below is worth 3 points, for a total of 6 points.
See Canvas_ for more details on each assignment.

*Discussion Observation*

The first observation will be me observing one of your discussion sections, preferably early in the quarter.
I will ask you to submit a list of when you teach discussions on Canvas, and I'll observe one of those and give you feedback.
I'll let you know ahead of time when I plan on attending.

*Discussion Recording and Consultation*

The Center for Educational Effectiveness (or CEE_) promotes and supports effective learning for all UC Davis students.
You're probably already met them at TA orientation.
One of CEE's offerings is going over a video recording of yourself with a TA Consultant.

The second observation involves going over a video recording of one of your discussions.
You will record yourself, and then meet with one of CEE's consultants to discuss the recording how you can improve as an instructor.

Track B - Everyone Else
"""""""""""""""""""""""

If you're not leading discussions, either because you're only grading or you're not a TA this quarter, then you're going to have two alternative assignments.
These revolve around exposing you to something new in terms of teaching.

Each of the workshops below (together with proof of attendance) is worth 3 points, for a total of 6 points.
See Canvas_ for more details on each assignment.

*Two Workshops*

The Center for Educational Effectiveness (or CEE_) promotes and supports effective learning for all UC Davis students.
You're probably already met them at TA orientation.
CEE holds workshops every quarter on a variety of topics to help you improve your teaching.

Your assignments will be to attend two separate CEE workshops, and write a short paragraph on what you've learned for each.
You can view all the available workshops on `CEE's website`_.
Feel free to attend any two that strike your fancy.
Note that you need to register ahead of time on each event's page.

*Graduate Teaching Certificate*

CEE offers a `graduate teaching certificate`_ if you attend five of six presentations listed on the flyer linked in this sentence.
This isn't required, but if you're interested in getting the certificate, feel free to attend more workshops.

*Observation Offer*

You will, admittedly, get a bit more out of this class if you're leading discussions.
That being said, if you do lead discussions in Winter or Spring this year, and would like somebody to observe you, I'm more than happy to do so.
Email me in the future when you're leading a discussion if you'd like to take me up on this offer.
If you're serious about wanting to improve, I'll meet you halfway.

CEE can also do observations, as well.
You can request an observation on `their website`_.
